    <p>We appreciate you coming – from near and far – to be with us 
    over this holiday weekend. Your attendance is as good a gift as any. 
    Who really needs a KitchenAid, anyway? (Though, in the event you find it necessary, they are available on Amazon).</p>

    <p>To add a little copper to our otherwise non-existent Moscow mule collection, 
    you can browse our "wants" over here at Zola. Or, if you feel inclined, take a minute or 
    two to peruse Target, West Elm, or Bed Bath & Beyond.</p>`
