<p>Our big day will be a semi-formal event, but we're sure (just about)
anything you want to wear will be fine. You know us, we're not uptight... 
just keep it classy. It should also be noted that Angela requests you
refrain from wearing a wedding dress, but if that's really all you have
to wear, she'd prefer you just come naked.</p>

<p style='text-align:center'><b>Kids/Nuggets</b></p>

<p>To allow guests (ahem, YOU!) to relax and enjoy themselves, we have 
made the very difficult decision to limit our guest list of nuggets to 
those in the wedding party, our nieces and nephews, and first cousins only. 
Please know that we adore your little ones...we truly do. We thank you for 
your understanding and hope that you are still be able to join us. Please 
contact us directly with any questions.</p>
