<p class='tagline'>Hi, we’re Jake and Angela. We’re pretty fond of one another.</p>
<hr />
<p><i>Our story is kind of long, so here’s a condensed version for you…</i></p>

<p>We met in CP U.S. Government class at Horlick High School 
(shoutout to Mr. Blaga for putting us together on his seating chart!), 
becoming the dynamic duo you all know and love in 2005.</p>

<p>Since then we’ve survived enjoyed many adventures... 
five years of college (that good “Super Senior” status), many road trips, 
over 112 hours watching Star Wars, a 4,000 mile trip to London to see a statue, 
two kickball cookouts, a VIP One Direction concert experience, 
and becoming fur parents to our precious Duke.</p>

<p>Now, we’re are going to embark on our greatest adventure yet.</p>

<p>While taking Duke for a walk along Lake Michigan, Jake asked to stop 
to try to catch a Pokemon. Oblivious, Angela obliged and decided to take 
a photo of the harbor for her Snap Story.</p> 

<p>After capturing the perfect shot, 
she turned to find Jake fumbling around in his pocket. "What the f*ck are you doing?", 
she asked.</p> 

<p>Finally, he pulled out what he’d been searching for… a thimble. 
Dropping to one knee with Duke at his side, Jake asked Angela to marry him and Duke.</p>

<p>Yep. That’s right, after 12 <s>looooooooooong</s> beautiful, unforgettable years... 
we will finally be <i>The Smetanas.</i></p>
